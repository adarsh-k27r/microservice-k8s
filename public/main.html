        <h2>1. What is Containerization?</h2> <br />
        <p>Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an application's code with all the files and
            libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure. Traditionally, to run any application on your computer, you
            had to install the version that matched your machine's operating system. For example, you needed to install
            the Windows version of a software package on a Windows machine. However, with containerization, you can
            create a single software package, or container, that runs on all types of devices and operating systems.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>2. What are the Benefits of Containerization?</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Developers use containerization to build and deploy modern applications because of the following advantages.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3> 1. Portability</h3>
        <p>
            Software developers use containerization to deploy applications in multiple environments without rewriting
            the
            program code. They build an application once and deploy it on multiple operating systems. For example, they
            run
            the same containers on Linux and Windows operating systems. Developers also upgrade legacy application code
            to
            modern versions using containers for deployment. </p> <br>

        <h3> 2. Scalability</h3>
        <p>
            Containers are lightweight software components that run efficiently. For example, a virtual machine can
            launch a
            containerized application faster because it doesn't need to boot an operating system. Therefore, software
            developers can easily add multiple containers for different applications on a single machine. The container
            cluster uses computing resources from the same shared operating system, but one container doesn't interfere
            with
            the operation of other containers. </p><br>

        <h3> 3. Fault tolerance</h3>
        <p>
            Software development teams use containers to build fault-tolerant applications. They use multiple containers
            to
            run microservices on the cloud. Because containerized microservices operate in isolated user spaces, a
            single
            faulty container doesn't affect the other containers. This increases the resilience and availability of the
            application. </p> <br>

        <h3> 4. Agility</h3>
        <p>
            Containerized applications run in isolated computing environments. Software developers can troubleshoot and
            change the application code without interfering with the operating system, hardware, or other application
            services. They can shorten software release cycles and work on updates quickly with the container model.
        </p> <br>

        <h2>3. What are containerization use cases?</h2> <br>
        <p>The following are some use cases of containerization. </p><br>

        <h3> 1. Cloud migration</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud migration, or the lift-and-shift approach, is a software strategy that involves encapsulating legacy
            applications in containers and deploying them in a cloud computing environment. Organizations can modernize
            their applications without rewriting the entire software code. </p> <br>

        <h3> 2. Adoption of microservice architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations seeking to build cloud applications with microservices require containerization technology.
            The
            microservice architecture is a software development approach that uses multiple, interdependent software
            components to deliver a functional application. Each microservice has a unique and specific function. A
            modern
            cloud application consists of multiple microservices. For example, a video streaming application might have
            microservices for data processing, user tracking, billing, and personalization. Containerization provides
            the
            software tool to pack microservices as deployable programs on different platforms. </p> <br>

        <h3> 3. IoT devices</h3>
        <p>
            Internet of Things (IoT) devices contain limited computing resources, making manual software updating a
            complex
            process. Containerization allows developers to deploy and update applications across IoT devices easily.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>4. What is container orchestration?</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Container orchestration is a software technology that allows the automatic management of containers. This is
            necessary for modern cloud application development because an application might contain thousands of
            microservices in their respective containers. The large number of containerized microservices makes it
            impossible for software developers to manage them manually. </p><br>

        <h2 class="vm-vs">Virtual-Machines vs Containers</h2> <br>
        <img src="vm-vs-docker2.png" alt="vm-vs-docker2" /> <br>

        <h3>Benefits of container orchestration</h3>
        <p>
            Developers use container orchestration tools to automatically start, stop, and manage containers. Container
            orchestrators allow developers to scale cloud applications precisely and avoid human errors. For example,
            you
            can verify that containers are deployed with adequate resources from the host platform.

        </p> <br>

        <h2>5. What are the types of container technology?</h2> <br>
        <p>The following are some examples of popular technologies that developers use for containerization. </p> <br>

        <h3>1. Docker</h3>
        <p>
            Docker, or Docker Engine, is a popular open-source container runtime that allows software developers to
            build,
            deploy, and test containerized applications on various platforms. Docker containers are self-contained
            packages
            of applications and related files that are created with the Docker framework. </p><br>

        <h2 class="vm-vs">Docker Architecture</h2> <br>
        <img src="docker-ar.png" alt="docker-architecture" /> <br>

        <h3>2. Linux</h3>
        <p>
            Linux is an open-source operating system with built-in container technology. Linux containers are
            self-contained
            environments that allow multiple Linux-based applications to run on a single host machine. Software
            developers
            use Linux containers to deploy applications that write or read large amounts of data. Linux containers do
            not
            copy the entire operating system to their virtualized environment. Instead, the containers consist of
            necessary
            functionalities allocated in the Linux namespace. </p> <br>

        <h3>3. Kubernetes</h3>
        <p>
            Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestrator that software developers use to deploy, scale,
            and
            manage a vast number of microservices. It has a declarative model that makes automating containers easier.
            The
            declarative model ensures that Kubernetes takes the appropriate action to fulfil the requirements based on
            the
            configuration files.</p> <br>
